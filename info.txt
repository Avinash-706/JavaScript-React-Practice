1. WHAT IS A CDN?
// A CDN (Content Delivery Network) is a network of distributed servers 
// that deliver web content (like scripts, stylesheets, images) to users 
// from the server closest to them. 
// Purpose: Faster load times and better performance for global users.


2. WHAT IS 'crossorigin' IN A CDN LINK?
// The 'crossorigin' attribute is used when loading resources (like React from a CDN) 
// that may come from a different origin (domain).
// It tells the browser how to handle CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing).
// It ensures that certain requests (like fetching source maps or modules) 
// are allowed and won't be blocked by security restrictions.



3. Syntax: const element = React.createElement(type, props, children)
                            â†“
// The {} is where we pass the 'props' (attributes).
// Example: React.createElement("h1", { className: "title" }, "Hello World");
// So inside {} we can define all the HTML attributes for that element.


const parent = React.createElement("div", {id : "parent"}, "React.createElement("div", {id : "child"}, "Hello World"), Hello World");
